## üéØ Step-by-Step: Creating the GitHub Issue

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web UI (Easiest)

1. **Navigate to:** https://github.com/RETR0-OS/ModelForge/issues/new

2. **Choose template:** Click "Bug report"

3. **Title:**
   ```
   üêõ Critical Bug: Database Schema Mismatch Causes Fine-Tuning to Fail [FIXED]
   ```

4. **Description:** Copy content from `ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md` OR use this summary:

   ```markdown
   **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in PR #[PR_NUMBER]
   
   ## Problem
   The fine-tuning router attempted to save an `is_custom_base_model` field to the database, 
   but this field was missing from the database schema. This caused:
   - Database insertion failures
   - Fine-tuned models not appearing in the UI
   - Custom models being created on disk but not tracked in the database
   
   ## Solution
   1. ‚úÖ Added `is_custom_base_model` BOOLEAN column to database schema
   2. ‚úÖ Implemented automatic migration for existing databases
   3. ‚úÖ Updated INSERT statements to include new field
   4. ‚úÖ Ensured backward compatibility with zero data loss
   
   ## Testing
   - ‚úÖ Tested new database creation with updated schema
   - ‚úÖ Tested automatic migration from old schema to new schema
   - ‚úÖ Verified custom and recommended models save correctly
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed backward compatibility maintained
   - ‚úÖ No data loss during migration
   
   ## Files Changed
   - `ModelForge/utilities/settings_managers/DBManager.py`
   
   See `ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md` for complete technical documentation.
   
   **Fixed in commit:** 5a8df25
   ```

5. **Labels:** Add these labels:
   - `bug`
   - `database`
   - `fixed`
   - `high-priority`

6. **Click:** "Submit new issue"

7. **After creation:**
   - Link the issue to this PR
   - Close the issue with a comment: "Fixed in PR #[PR_NUMBER]"

### Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (If Available)

If you have `gh` CLI installed:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/ModelForge/ModelForge

gh issue create \
  --title "üêõ Critical Bug: Database Schema Mismatch Causes Fine-Tuning to Fail [FIXED]" \
  --body "$(cat ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md)" \
  --label "bug,database,fixed,high-priority"
```

---

### Method 3: Using curl with GitHub API

If you have a GitHub personal access token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/RETR0-OS/ModelForge/issues \
  -d '{
    "title": "üêõ Critical Bug: Database Schema Mismatch Causes Fine-Tuning to Fail [FIXED]",
    "body": "See ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md in the repository for complete details. Fixed in PR #[PR_NUMBER]",
    "labels": ["bug", "database", "fixed", "high-priority"]
  }'
```
