# How to Create the GitHub Issue for This Bug Fix

This document provides instructions for creating a GitHub issue to track this bug fix.

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/RETR0-OS/ModelForge/issues/new
2. Click "Bug report" template
3. Use the following content:

### Title
```
üêõ Critical Bug: Database Schema Mismatch Causes Fine-Tuning to Fail [FIXED]
```

### Body
Copy the content from `ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md` or use this summary:

```markdown
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in PR #[PR_NUMBER]

## Problem
The fine-tuning router attempted to save an `is_custom_base_model` field to the database, but this field was missing from the database schema. This caused:
- Database insertion failures
- Fine-tuned models not appearing in the UI
- Custom models being created on disk but not tracked in the database

## Solution
1. ‚úÖ Added `is_custom_base_model` BOOLEAN column to database schema
2. ‚úÖ Implemented automatic migration for existing databases
3. ‚úÖ Updated INSERT statements to include new field
4. ‚úÖ Ensured backward compatibility with zero data loss

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Tested new database creation with updated schema
- ‚úÖ Tested automatic migration from old schema to new schema
- ‚úÖ Verified custom and recommended models save correctly
- ‚úÖ Confirmed backward compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ No data loss during migration

## Files Changed
- `ModelForge/utilities/settings_managers/DBManager.py`

See `ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md` for complete technical documentation.
```

### Labels
- `bug`
- `database`
- `fixed`
- `high-priority`

  --body-file ISSUE_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH.md \
  --label "bug,database,fixed,high-priority"
```
